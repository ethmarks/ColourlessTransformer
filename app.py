# ColourlessTransformer

Created by **Ethan Marks** ([@ethmarks](https://github.com/ethmarks)).

[ColourlessTransformer](https://ethmarks.github.io/blog/colourlesstransformer/) is an interface for the Paint Transformer neural network, which performs feed-forward neural painting with stroke prediction.

## Usage

1. **Upload an Image:** Use the file uploader to drag and drop an image or select it from your file system. Supported formats: .png, .jpg, .jpeg.
2. **Set Parameters (optional):** Change how ColourlessTransformer processes your image by configuring the settings.
    - **Animation**: allows you to choose whether to generate a static image of the finished image or an animated GIF showing the entire painting process.
    - **Resize**: resizes the input image to a maximum of 512 pixels. This is **highly recommended**, as it vastly decreases processing time and memory usage without significantly affecting the quality of the output.
3. **Generate Results:** Click the Generate button to process your uploaded image. Depending on your hardware, the processing should take between a few seconds and a few minutes.
4. **View Results:** Once processing is complete, view the result in the right column. You can download the result by right-clicking and selecting "Save Image As...".
